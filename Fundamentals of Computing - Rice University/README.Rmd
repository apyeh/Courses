### Note:

In order to run properly, all of the programs that were written for these Rice University Coursera courses need to be opened and run in CodeSkulptor (http://www.codeskulptor.org), which is a browser-based programming environment for the programming language Python that was developed by Prof. Scott Rixner at Rice University.
